# TradeGuard

TradeGuard is a B2B risk, evidence, and dispute activation tool for cross-border sellers.

Phase 1 MVP focuses on one end-to-end flow:

1. Search a buyer company
2. Return a credit grade and risk flags
3. Upload a contract or chat transcript
4. Generate evidence hash and notarization record
5. Prepare a legal trigger package

## Product Scope

- Credit lookup
- Evidence notarization
- Blockchain anchor and legal trigger design
- Notification workflow

Tariff risk is documented for Phase 2 and not included in the first engineering sprint.
